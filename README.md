# A Linux build of I Wanna Be The Creator and related TAS resources. 

This is something that I've been dreaming of doing since the release of libTAS. 

Now it has finally come true with a Linux version of this game from the original creator of this game! 

In [releases](https://github.com/happymimimix/IWBTC-Linux/releases), you will find everything you need to create a tool assisted speedrun for your favorite iwanna fanmade level in I Wanna Be The Creator.
